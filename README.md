# CSCI243Project6

Project 6, CSCI243 Programming II, Spring 2020

Project 6 is another four function calculator that is an exercise in using stacks 
and queues. The challenge with this is to build a calculator that works in reverse 
Polish notation. Reverse Polish Notation is an unambibous way to write arithmatic. So,
(5-4)x3 would be writting as 5 4 - 3 5 x +. And, in the calculator, numbers are differentiated
by a decmial, so that would be inputed as 5.4-3.5x+.
